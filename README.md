# Parallax-Effect-Website-With-HTML
The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by making the background move at a different speed than the foreground elements as the user scrolls.
In this example, the website consists of multiple sections with different background images (image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc.). Each section has a .parallax-section class and a corresponding background image.

The .parallax-container class defines the container that holds all the parallax sections. The .parallax-section class sets the height and background properties for each section. The content of each section is placed within a .parallax-content class, which is centered vertically and horizontally.

The JavaScript code adds a scroll event listener to create the parallax effect. As the user scrolls, the code calculates the vertical translation for each section based on its assigned data-speed attribute. The higher the data-speed value, the slower the section will move, creating the parallax effect.

You can replace the image1.jpg, image2.jpg, etc., with your own background images to customize the appearance. Additionally, you can adjust the number of sections and their content as needed.

Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the parallax effect in action. Scroll up and down to observe the background movement.
